			<p>
			SecretShot prevents Snapchat from detecting when you take screenshots or screen recordings. When enabled, users whose snaps you screenshot or screen record will not be notified. SecretShot does not hook Snapchat classes, meaning Snapchat will not detect any tweak injection. Thus, you will not be banned.
